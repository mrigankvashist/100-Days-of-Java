# Is A Prime

In this problem you have to check whether a given number is prime or not.

At first you need to take a number "t" as input representing the count of input numbers to be tested. And then take a number "n" as input, "t" number of times.

Hint: this problem can be solved by simply running the loop from 1 to n for and subsequently dividing the variable so as to get the remainder as 0, but that would require > 10^8 operations
