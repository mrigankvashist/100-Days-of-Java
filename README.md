 100 Days of Java is an initiative I am commiting to take, where I will be spending each day working on problem solving and personal projects to improve my skills and push my boundaries.

I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:
1. Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Update my Progress daily with informative README's.

My Exceptions:
- If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day
- My University work, and few emergencies might demand to take a day off

# Day 1
- ### Basics: 
Going through the basics and syntax of java with minimal hello world, addition, subtraction programs.
- ### Is A Prime: 
In this problem you have to check whether a given number is prime or not.

- ### Prime till n: 
You have to print all prime numbers between a range from low to high.

# Day 2
- ### Fibonacci Series:
Print first n fibonacci numbers.

- ### Count Digits in Number:
Count the number of digits in a number.

- ### Reverse a Number:
Display the digits of a number in reverse.

- ### Inverse of a Number:
 Interchange the face value and index of digits of number with a constraint  that if the number is 5 digits long, it should contain all the digits from 1 to 5 without missing any and without repeating any. Eg. inverse of 2134 is 1243 and inverse of 24153 is 24153.

# Day 3
- ### Rotate a number:
Given two numbers n and k, you are required to rotate n, k times to the right. If k is positive, rotate to the right i.e. remove rightmost digit and make it leftmost. Do the reverse for negative value of k

- ### GCD and LCM :
Required to print the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

- ### Prime Factorization :
Display the prime factorization of a number

- ### Pythagorean Triplet :
You are required to check if a given set of numbers is a valid pythagorean triplet.
