 100 Days of Java is an initiative I am commiting to take, where I will be spending each day working on problem solving and personal projects to improve my skills and push my boundaries.

I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:
1. Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Update my Progress daily with informative README's.

My Exceptions:
- If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day
- My University work, and few emergencies might demand to take a day off

# Day 1
- ### Basics: 
Going through the basics and syntax of java with minimal hello world, addition, subtraction programs.
- ### Is A Prime: 
In this problem you have to check whether a given number is prime or not.

- ### Prime till n: 
You have to print all prime numbers between a range from low to high.

# Day 2
- ### Fibonacci Series:
Print first n fibonacci numbers.

- ### Count Digits in Number:
Count the number of digits in a number.

- ### Reverse a Number:
Display the digits of a number in reverse.

- ### Inverse of a Number:
 Interchange the face value and index of digits of number with a constraint  that if the number is 5 digits long, it should contain all the digits from 1 to 5 without missing any and without repeating any. Eg. inverse of 2134 is 1243 and inverse of 24153 is 24153.

# Day 3
- ### Rotate a number:
Given two numbers n and k, you are required to rotate n, k times to the right. If k is positive, rotate to the right i.e. remove rightmost digit and make it leftmost. Do the reverse for negative value of k

- ### GCD and LCM :
Required to print the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

- ### Prime Factorization :
Display the prime factorization of a number

- ### Pythagorean Triplet :
You are required to check if a given set of numbers is a valid pythagorean triplet.

# Day 4
- ### Curious Case Of Benjamin Bulbs:
You are given n number of bulbs. They are all switched off. A weird fluctuation in voltage hits the circuit n times. In the 1st fluctuation all bulbs are toggled, in the 2nd fluctuation every 2nd bulb is toggled, in the 3rd fluctuation every 3rd bulb is toggled and so on. You've to find which bulbs will be switched on after n fluctuations. 
Let i/p n be the number of bulbs.
Print all the bulbs that will be on after the nth fluctuation in voltage.
