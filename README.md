 100 Days of Java is an initiative I am commiting to take, where I will be spending each day working on problem solving and personal projects to improve my skills and push my boundaries.

I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:
1. Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Update my Progress daily with informative README's.

My Exceptions:
- If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day
- My University work, and few emergencies might demand to take a day off

# Day 1
- ### Basics: 
Going through the basics and syntax of java with minimal hello world, addition, subtraction programs.
- ### Is A Prime: 
In this problem you have to check whether a given number is prime or not.

- ### Prime till n: 
You have to print all prime numbers between a range from low to high.

# Day 2
- ### Fibonacci Series:
Print first n fibonacci numbers.

- ### Count Digits in Number:
Count the number of digits in a number
