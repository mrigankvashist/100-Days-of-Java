 100 Days of Java is an initiative I am commiting to take, where I will be spending each day working on problem solving and personal projects to improve my skills and push my boundaries.

I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:
1. Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Update my Progress daily with informative README's.

My Exceptions:
- If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day
- My University work, and few emergencies might demand to take a day off

# Day 1
- ### Is A Prime: 
In this problem you have to check whether a given number is prime or not.
At first you need to take a number "t" as input representing the count of input numbers to be tested. And then take a number "n" as input, "t" number of times.
Hint: this problem can be solved by simply running the loop from 1 to n for and subsequently dividing the variable so as to get the remainder as 0, but that would require > 10^8 operations
